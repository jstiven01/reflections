When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
R: When I work with differente people in Collaboration way or this remote repository can work like a backup of my projects

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
R: Because there could be files that you did not add, files of someone else and you do not want to save this changes in your local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
R: Forks means cloning github repository into another Github repository (No local)
   Clones could work on local repository too
   Branches is the different paths that your code could take inside the local or github repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
R: The benefit is that you have a real version of the software with all the features. it could avoid problems of synch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
R: I would collaborate splitting the work into different features, coding in a modular way. Everyone would have your own module. 
   There no would be conflicts but it would be hard to centralize all the changes and synchonized with all the mates.
